Complexity. Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is big O of m times n, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we iterate through all cells of the matrix once to assign values based on the minimum of the current row and column sums. Space complexity: The space complexity is big O of m times n as well, as we create a matrix of size m times n to store the values.
